  # through to a reply, a resolution and a rating.
  #
  # These stages do not strictly shrink. A conversation can be resolved with no agent
  # reply at all — closed by a bot or closed unanswered — so `resolved` may exceed
  # `answered`. That gap is the point of the report, so it is reported rather than
  # smoothed over: `unanswered` and `resolved_without_answer` name it directly.
