  # Chatwoot has no "resolution reason" field, so the labels carried by a resolved
  # conversation stand in for it. That substitution is only worth anything alongside
  # its coverage: an account that labels 15% of its closures has a ranking describing
  # 15% of reality. `unlabelled` reports that share instead of hiding it.
  #
  # A conversation can carry several labels, so the per-label counts add up to more
  # than `labelled`. They count (resolution, label) pairs, not resolutions.
